# Astrafy Covid Model:

This model is based on multiple sources:
- The New York Times US Coronavirus Database: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
- US Vaccinations: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations/
- US Population: https://worldpopulationreview.com/states
- States Boundaries: Bigquery Public Data

With this model we try to understand the global state of covid19, correlations between deaths, cases and vaccinations and to identify some patterns.

This model can be improved with more reliable et detail data. 
For instance, the population sources could be better with a daily or monthly level of detail, moreover there are some missing data (e.g. 2021 population)
